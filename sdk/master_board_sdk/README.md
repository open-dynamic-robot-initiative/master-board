# SDK

The SDK provide a simple C++ class interface to send command to the masterboard via Ethernet or Wifi.

## Prepare you interface

You first need to identify you interface name. To get a list of the interface on your computer, run `ifconfig`

#### Ethernet

A direct connection should me made between the master board and you computer. It is not possible to use the same interface for local network and master board connection.

###### Optional configuration:

Some packet will be sent by the OS to the master board. Their are not usefull since the master board only use raw MAC frame.
To disable ARP packet run:

```
sudo ifconfig MY_INTERFACE -arp
```

where MY_INTERFACE is your lan interface name.

To disable IPV6 trafic, add this line into ` /etc/sysctl.conf`

```
net.ipv6.conf.MY_INTERFACE.disable_ipv6 = 1
```

where MY_INTERFACE is your lan interface name.

##### Optional configuration (macOS):

To disable IPV6 and IPV4 you can use

```
networksetup -listnetworkserviceorder
```

to have the list of NetworkService (Hardware Port) related to the interface.

It is then possible to switch off IPV6 with:

```
networksetup -setv6off NetworkService
```

#### Wifi

Your interface should support monitor mode and injection since the procol used by the master board is not a standard wifi.
You need to configure your interface. A script is available in the sdk folder. to use it run

```
sudo ./setup_wifi.sh MY_INTERFACE
```

where MY_INTERFACE your wlan interface name.

## How to run the C++ example

main.cpp is a simple example to test the SDK, tested on ubuntu.
It will execute a sinusoid trajectory on the first N_CONTROLLED_SLAVE
to compile it go into the sdk folder and run:

```
make
```

a bin folder is created.
to run the example run:

```
sudo ./bin/exec MY_INTERFACE
```

where MY_INTERFACE is the name of the network interface used to connect to the master board.

## How to run the Python examples

- Clone the repository: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/open-dynamic-robot-initiative/master-board.git`

- Get into the repository: `cd master-board`

- Set the number of controlled drivers by opening `sdk/master_board_sdk/example/example.py` and tuning the `N_SLAVES_CONTROLED` constant: `N_SLAVES_CONTROLED 4` if you are using 4 driver boards (1 per leg)

- Get in `sdk/master_board_sdk/`: `cd sdk/master_board_sdk/`

- Create a build folder: `mkdir build`

- Get into the folder: `cd build`

- Two possibilities:

  - Using `ccmake ..` turn on Python bindings by setting `BUILD_PYTHON_INTERFACE` to `ON` and `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` to `RELEASE`. Then compile and create the bindings: `cmake ..` then `make`
  - Directly use `cmake -DBUILD_PYTHON_INTERFACE=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ..` then `make`. If you want to run the scripts with Python 3 then use `cmake -DBUILD_PYTHON_INTERFACE=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=$(which python3) ..` instead.

- Run the control script with the name of your Ethernet interface instead of `name_interface` (for instance `enp1s0`):

`sudo PYTHONPATH=. python example/example.pyc -i name_interface`

- Run the listener script with the name of your Ethernet interface instead of `name_interface` (for instance `enp1s0`):

`sudo PYTHONPATH=. python example/listener.pyc -i name_interface`

- Run the communication analyser script with the name of your Ethernet interface instead of `name_interface` (for instance `enp1s0`):

`sudo PYTHONPATH=. python example/com_analyser.pyc -i name_interface`

## How to run an executable based on the SDK without root permissions

To run an executable named EXECUTABLE_NAME without root permissions, run :

```
sudo setcap cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw+ep EXECUTABLE_NAME
```

remember to reset the capabilities on python if you use it other you can [get into trouble](https://answers.ros.org/question/366380/ubuntu1804ros2-dashing-failed-to-load-entry-point-issue/):

```
sudo setcap -r /usr/bin/python3.6
```

## Building the SDK with Nix

From the repository's root directory, run:

```
nix build
```

If you want to run demo scripts (in the `demos/` folder), you can enter a shell with python and all the required dependencies (including the SDK's python bindings)

```
nix develop
```

Then, simply run the demo scripts with `python`.
